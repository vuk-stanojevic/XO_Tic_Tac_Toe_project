Hi! I'm Vuk Stanojevic and this is my mini project done in IT Bootcamp. It was done on Java in IntelliJ IDEA. 

It's a classic game of tic-tac-toe or XO (iks-oks), something we have all played while we were bored in classes :D.

This is a two-player game with a minimal graphical interface which is printed in the console. Players take their turns and
make moves by entering a field number (1-9). If the field is already populated, a message for non-valid moves will pop up.
The first player to connect three in a row wins. Also, it is possible to end the game in a draw.

I did the method which checks if a field is empty in four different ways. The one I chose to use was the shortest one and 
the other ones are left as comments.

I'm happy to receive any feedback, suggestions and proposals, so feel free to contact me by email at (vukstanojevic42[at]gmail[dot]com).
